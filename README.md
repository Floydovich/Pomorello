# Pomorello

Pomorello is a light Trello Power-Up for tracking Pomodoro sets.

## Usage

Pomorello is currently under active development.
Upon initial release, it will (hopefully) be available as a Power-Up within Trello.

To use Pomorello, first add it to the board's list of Power-Ups

[//]: # Image will go here

Next, select the card you want to work on, and click the Pomorello button.

[//]: # Another image here, maybe a video/animation

Finally, select the option corresponding to your preferred settings.

[//]: # One last image/video

That's it! you're all set to start working.

## Why Pomorello?

Pomorello sets itself apart from other applications because it:
- Is completely free
- Is entirely contained in Trello: no sign-ups, no extra accounts, no external websites
- Is easy to use
- Is open-source and community driven. If you want a feature, you can create an issue or PR to add it yourself.

- Add more options for set lengths
- Add stats display
- Add card-back status
- Add a logo
- Add images to this README
- Add sounds

- Add optional clearing of Power-Up data
