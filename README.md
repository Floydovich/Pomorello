That's it! you're all set to start working.

## Why Pomorello?

Pomorello sets itself apart from other applications because it:
- Is completely free
- Is entirely contained in Trello: no sign-ups, no extra accounts, no external websites
- Is easy to use
- Is open-source and community driven. If you want a feature, you can create an issue or PR to add it yourself

## TODOs

- Add optional clearing of Power-Up data
- Add data export
- Add instant-finish option

## Privacy

Pomorello is self-contained in Trello, and does not collect any data.
Only enough data to track the time is stored, and this is done directly on the
trello board. If the card/list/board goes, so does the stored data.
