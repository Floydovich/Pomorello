# Pomorello

Pomorello is a light Trello Power-Up for tracking Pomodoro sets.

## Usage

Pomorello is currently under active development.
Upon initial release, it will (hopefully) be available as a Power-Up within Trello.

To use Pomorello, first add it to the board's list of Power-Ups

That's it! you're all set to start working.

## Why Pomorello?

Pomorello sets itself apart from other applications because it:
- Is completely free
- Is entirely contained in Trello: no sign-ups, no extra accounts, no external websites
- Is easy to use
- Is open-source and community driven. If you want a feature, you can create an issue or PR to add it yourself.

## TODOs

- Add more options for set lengths
- Add stats display
- Add a logo
- Add sounds
- Add optional clearing of Power-Up data
- Add data export
