# Pomorello

Pomorello is a light Trello Power-Up for tracking Pomodoro sets.

## Usage

Pomorello is currently under active development.
Upon initial release, it will (hopefully) be available as a Power-Up within Trello.

## Why Pomorello?

With **many** widely available time tracking tools, one might wonder why this is different.

The primary motives behind the creation of Pomorello are to create an application which:
- Is completely free
- Is entirely self-contained: no sign-ups, no extra accounts, no external websites
- Is easy to use
- Is open-source and community driven. If someone wants an additional feature, they can request it, or add it themselves.
